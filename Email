Hi Kavya,

Thank you for the invitation to the GenAI GraphTalk for BFSI event in Mumbai.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend tomorrow's session due to some unforeseen personal reasons. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I appreciate you offering the option to join virtually and will consider doing so if my schedule permits.

My email address is am.

Thanks,
Abhinav
