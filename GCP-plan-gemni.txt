Migrating a Spring Boot microservice application from on-premises VMs to GCP while keeping the database on-premises requires careful planning. Here's a detailed plan covering key aspects:

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning**

1.  **Application Assessment:**
    *   **Dependencies:** Identify all dependencies, including internal services for authorization and reference data.  Document their connection details (URLs, ports, authentication methods).  Crucially, assess if these internal services are accessible from GCP.  If not, you'll need to establish connectivity (VPN, Direct Peering).
    *   **Resource Requirements:** Analyze CPU, memory, and storage needs for each microservice.  This will help size your GCP instances appropriately.
    *   **Networking:** Map out current network topology and plan the GCP network setup, including VPCs, subnets, firewall rules, and connectivity to on-premises (VPN or Direct Peering).  Consider IP address ranges and DNS.
    *   **Security:** Review current security measures and plan how to replicate or enhance them in GCP.  This includes authentication, authorization, data encryption (in transit and at rest), and vulnerability scanning.
    *   **Database Connectivity:**  Since the database remains on-premises, evaluate the latency and bandwidth requirements for database access from GCP.  Test the connection thoroughly.  Consider solutions like Cloud VPN or Direct Peering for optimal performance.  JDBC connection strings, drivers, and any required security configurations need to be planned.
    *   **Monitoring and Logging:**  Plan how to monitor the application's performance and health in GCP.  Choose appropriate logging and monitoring tools (Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring).
    *   **Deployment Strategy:** Decide on a deployment strategy (e.g., blue/green, canary).  Automate the deployment process as much as possible.  Consider using tools like Cloud Build or Jenkins.
    *   **Cost Estimation:** Use the GCP pricing calculator to estimate the costs of compute, storage, networking, and other services.

2.  **Proof of Concept (POC):**
    *   Select a non-critical microservice for the POC.
    *   Set up the GCP environment (VPC, subnets, firewall rules).
    *   Establish connectivity between GCP and on-premises (VPN or Direct Peering).
    *   Deploy the chosen microservice to GCP (e.g., using Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, or Cloud Run).
    *   Test the application thoroughly, including database connectivity, authorization, and access to reference data.
    *   Evaluate performance, security, and cost.  Refine the plan based on the POC results.

**Phase 2: Migration Execution**

1.  **Infrastructure Setup:**
    *   Create the required GCP resources (VPCs, subnets, firewall rules, load balancers, etc.).
    *   Configure connectivity between GCP and on-premises (VPN or Direct Peering).
    *   Set up monitoring and logging.

2.  **Deployment:**
    *   Automate the deployment process using Cloud Build, Jenkins, or similar tools.
    *   Deploy microservices to GCP one by one or in small groups, starting with less critical services.  Use your chosen deployment strategy (blue/green, canary).
    *   Configure load balancing to distribute traffic across instances.
    *   Thoroughly test each microservice after deployment.

3.  **Database Connection Configuration:**
    *   Configure your Spring Boot applications to connect to the on-premises database.  Use the appropriate JDBC driver and connection string.  Ensure that the necessary firewall rules are in place to allow database access from GCP.  Test the database connection rigorously.

4.  **Security Implementation:**
    *   Implement security measures, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
    *   Configure access control to GCP resources.
    *   Implement vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.

5.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Set up monitoring and logging to track the application's performance and health.
    *   Configure alerts for critical events.

6.  **Cutover:**
    *   Switch traffic from the on-premises environment to GCP.
    *   Monitor the application closely after the cutover.

**Phase 3: Post-Migration**

1.  **Performance Tuning:**
    *   Analyze the application's performance in GCP and make adjustments as needed.
    *   Optimize database queries and network connectivity.

2.  **Cost Optimization:**
    *   Review GCP costs and identify opportunities for optimization.
    *   Right-size instances and use appropriate storage options.

3.  **Security Review:**
    *   Conduct a thorough security review to ensure that the application is secure in GCP.

4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update documentation to reflect the new GCP environment.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Database Connectivity:** This is a crucial aspect. Thoroughly test the connection between your application in GCP and the on-premises database.  Pay close attention to latency and bandwidth.  Consider database connection pooling to optimize performance.
*   **Security:** Implement a robust security strategy to protect your application and data.
*   **Automation:** Automate as much of the migration process as possible to reduce errors and improve efficiency.
*   **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track the application's performance and health.
*   **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in place in case of issues during or after the migration.
*   **Team Training:** Ensure that your team is trained on GCP services and tools.

This detailed plan provides a solid foundation for migrating your Spring Boot microservice application to GCP. Remember to tailor the plan to your specific requirements and constraints.  The POC is a *critical* step to validate your approach and identify potential issues early on.
