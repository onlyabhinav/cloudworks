Here are **three updated versions** of your introduction with **DORA metrics** naturally embedded.
I’ve positioned it in a way that shows you are aligned with organizational priorities and already contributing at a strategic level — which is great for a **promotion interview**.

---

# ⭐ **1. Standard Introduction (Balanced + Professional)**

**“Thank you for the opportunity.
I’m Abhinav, currently a Technical Lead with 15 years of experience in Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices in the banking domain. I’ve been leading key modernization and digital transformation initiatives including Google Cloud POCs and the Oracle-to-Postgres (EDB) migration, reducing technical debt and preparing our applications for future-ready architecture.**

**At the engineering level, I strongly align with our organization’s focus on DORA metrics. I actively work on improving deployment frequency, reducing lead time for changes, and strengthening reliability through better automation, CI/CD practices, and improved code quality. I collaborate closely with DevOps, QA, and Infra teams to ensure our releases are stable, compliant, and faster over time.**

**I’m now looking to move into the next-level role where I can influence architecture more broadly, guide teams on modernization, and drive engineering excellence aligned with our DORA objectives.”**

# ⭐ **2. Technical Manager–Focused Introduction (Leadership + Delivery)**

**“I’m Abhinav, Technical Lead with 15 years of experience building enterprise-grade solutions using Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices. I’ve played a key role in our digital transformation journey — leading Google Cloud POCs and driving the Oracle-to-Postgres migration with strong collaboration across DBA, DevOps, and Infra teams.**

**A major focus in my current role has been improving DORA metrics, which are central to our organization. I work on optimizing deployment pipelines, reducing lead time, improving release quality, and lowering MTTR by strengthening observability and automation. I also mentor developers, drive coding standards, and lead design discussions that directly impact our delivery performance.**

**I now look forward to contributing from a Technical Manager perspective — guiding multiple teams, shaping engineering strategy, and accelerating our modernization goals.”**

# ⭐ **3. Architect-Focused Introduction (Architecture + Engineering Excellence)**

**“I’m Abhinav, a Technical Lead with 15 years of experience in Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices. I’ve been deeply involved in modernization and digital transformation, including Google Cloud POCs and leading the Oracle-to-Postgres (EDB) migration. These initiatives strengthened our platform’s scalability, performance, and cloud readiness.**

**DORA metrics are at the core of our engineering culture, and my work directly contributes to improving them. I focus on designing architectures and pipelines that reduce lead time, increase deployment frequency, and enhance reliability. Through better service design, automation, and performance tuning, I’ve helped make our systems more resilient and operationally efficient.**

**I’m now aiming for an Architect role where I can influence engineering practices, technical standards, and modernization strategies at an enterprise level — fully aligned with our DORA-first transformation vision.”**

# ⭐ If you want, I can also customize it further:

✅ Mention specific examples (e.g., “reduced lead time by X%”)
✅ Add cloud modernization language
✅ Make it more leadership-heavy
✅ Create a 20-second DORA-focused version

Just tell me your target role (Technical Manager / Architect / VP) and tone (formal / conversational), and I’ll refine it perfectly.
