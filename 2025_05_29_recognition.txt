**Subject: Commendation for [Your Name]'s Impactful GCP Initiative**

[Your Name] is highly commended for their exceptional leadership in spearheading a proof-of-concept GCP migration for a DEV server, which demonstrated a remarkable cost reduction from \$75k to \$25k annually for a single server with significant potential savings across the department's ~100 servers. By strategically implementing Preemptible VMs, VM Scheduling, and overcoming challenges in GCP-to-on-prem service communication, [Your Name] not only achieved these savings but also engineered a "one-click infrastructure creation" job. This innovation dramatically slashed provisioning time from one month to mere minutes, enabling end-to-end automation from infrastructure setup to application deployment, and fostering greater parallel experimentation. [Your Name]'s initiative, problem-solving skills, and successful collaboration have delivered substantial value and set a new benchmark for efficiency.
