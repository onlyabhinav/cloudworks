PPT Script for Cloud
-------------------

"Good morning. This question – 'Why build walls when you can fly in clouds?' – really sets the stage for what we're about to discuss. Traditionally, our infrastructure, much like walls, has provided security and structure. But it can also mean fixed costs and limitations.
Today, we'll show how 'flying in the clouds,' specifically with Google Cloud, is allowing our Capital Markets DEV environments to break free from some of those constraints, unlocking significant agility and, most importantly, substantial cost savings."


====================

Okay, here's a draft of your 7-minute presentation slides and script, focusing on cost savings for your Google Cloud POC in the Capital Markets department at MyBigBank.

**Title:** Unlocking Cost Efficiencies: Google Cloud POC for Capital Markets DEV Environments
**Subtitle:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Department:** Capital Markets Technology
**Date:** [Date of Presentation]

**Script (Approx. 30 seconds):**

"Good morning. We're here today to share exciting results from our recent Google Cloud Proof of Concept within the Capital Markets department, specifically focusing on how we can achieve significant cost savings by migrating our development environments."

---

**Slide 2: Executive Summary - POC Success & Strategic Alignment**

**(Visual: Upward trending graphArrow icon indicating cost reduction)**

**Key Messages:**

* **Successful POC:** Migrated a DEV Application Server to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* **Significant Cost Savings Identified:** Potential for **60-80% cost reduction** on DEV infrastructure using GCP.
* **Strategic Alignment:** Leverages MyBigBank's existing strategic partnership with Google Cloud.
* **Low-Risk Innovation:** Focused on non-production (DEV) to prove value.

**Script (Approx. 60 seconds):**

"Our Proof of Concept successfully migrated a Capital Markets application server for one of our development instances to Google Cloud. The key takeaway is a substantial opportunity: we project potential cost reductions of **60 to 80%** for this DEV server infrastructure. This initiative aligns perfectly with MyBigBank's broader strategic partnership with Google Cloud and demonstrates a low-risk path to innovate and optimize our development lifecycle costs, starting with our DEV environments."

**Slide 3: The Challenge: Current On-Premise DEV Environment Costs**

**(Visual: Image of a server rack, perhaps with a subtle "dollar drain" icon)**

**Key Messages:**

* **High Fixed Costs:** Dedicated hardware for DEV environments leads to significant upfront and ongoing expenses.
* **Underutilized Resources:** DEV servers often sit idle, yet still incur full costs (power, cooling, maintenance, licensing).
* **Slow Provisioning:** Setting up new DEV environments can be time-consuming.

**Script (Approx. 60 seconds):**

"Currently, our on-premise DEV environments present several cost challenges. We have high fixed costs tied to dedicated hardware, which often results in underutilized resources – servers running 24/7, consuming power and incurring maintenance, even when not actively used by developers. Furthermore, provisioning new DEV environments can be a lengthy process, impacting agility."

**Slide 4: Our Google Cloud POC: Focused & Strategic**

**(Visual: Simple diagram: [MyBigBank On-Premise Icon with DB server] <- Connection -> [GCP Icon with Application Server VM])**

**Key Messages:**

* **Scope:** Migrated **one Application Server** for a DEV instance.
* **Technology:** Leveraged Google Compute Engine.
* **Hybrid Approach (for POC):** Database remained on-premise for this initial phase.
* **Objective:** Validate feasibility and, crucially, quantify potential cost savings for DEV workloads.

**Script (Approx. 60 seconds):**

"For this POC, we took a focused approach. We migrated just the application server for one of our Capital Markets DEV instances to Google Compute Engine. The database for this DEV instance remained on-premise for the duration of the POC. Our primary goal was to validate the technical feasibility and, most importantly, to quantify the potential cost savings, especially for these non-production, intermittent workloads."

**Slide 5: The Key to DEV Cost Savings: Google Cloud Preemptible VMs**

**(Visual: GCP Preemptible VM icon, a large percentage saving like "-70%" next to it.)**

**Key Messages:**

* **Preemptible VMs:** Low-cost, short-lived compute instances on GCP.
* **Ideal for DEV/Test:** Perfect for workloads that can tolerate interruptions (like development, batch jobs).
* **Massive Cost Reduction:** Up to **60-91% cheaper** than standard VMs.
* **Pay-for-Use:** Only pay when the DEV environment is actually running.

**Script (Approx. 90 seconds):**

"The game-changer for our DEV environments on Google Cloud is the use of **Preemptible Virtual Machines** – or Spot VMs as they are now known. These are low-cost compute instances ideal for fault-tolerant workloads like development and testing, which don't require 24/7 uptime.

If a DEV server isn't being used, it doesn't need to run at full cost. Preemptible VMs can reduce compute costs by an astounding **60% to over 90%** compared to standard virtual machines. We effectively only pay for what we use, when our developers are actively using the environment. This aligns resource consumption directly with actual need, drastically cutting waste."

**Slide 6: Projected Annual Cost Savings (Single DEV App Server)**

**(Visual: A simple bar chart: "Current On-Prem DEV App Server Cost" (tall bar) vs. "Projected GCP DEV App Server Cost with Preemptible VM" (very short bar). Clearly show the percentage saving.)**

**Key Messages:**

* **Illustrative Annual Cost (On-Prem DEV App Server):** \$[Insert a realistic but illustrative annual cost, e.g., $10,000 - $15,000 - *State this is an estimate*]
* **Projected Annual Cost (GCP Preemptible VM for App Server):** \$[Calculated based on 70-80% saving, e.g., $2,000 - $4,500 - *State this is an estimate*]
* **Potential Annual Saving (per DEV App Server):** **~ \$[Difference, e.g., $7,000 - $11,500] (Approx. 70-80%)**
* *Disclaimer: Based on POC findings for application server only and estimated on-premise costs. Does not include DB costs.*

**Script (Approx. 90 seconds):**

"Let's look at the numbers. Based on our POC and typical on-premise costs for a development application server – which we estimate conservatively to be around \$X annually including hardware, power, cooling, and maintenance – migrating to a Google Cloud Preemptible VM could reduce that specific server's cost to approximately \$Y annually.

This translates to a potential annual saving of **around \$Z, or roughly 70-80%, for just *one* development application server.** It’s crucial to note these are estimates for the application server component only, as the database remained on-premise for this POC. However, the savings are clearly compelling."

*(Be prepared to briefly explain how you arrived at the on-prem estimate if asked, e.g., "Based on internal estimates of hardware lifecycle, power, cooling, and FTE maintenance allocation for similar servers.")*

**Slide 7: The Broader Opportunity & Our Recommendation**

**(Visual: Icons representing multiple DEV/Test environments transforming into GCP icons, with an overall cost reduction arrow.)**

**Key Messages:**

* **Scalable Savings:** Multiply savings across all Capital Markets DEV & Test application servers.
* **Increased Agility:** Faster provisioning of DEV environments.
* **Future Potential:** Explore migrating other workloads and eventually databases for further optimization.
* **Recommendation:**
    * **Phase 1:** Expand GCP Preemptible VM usage for all suitable Capital Markets DEV/Test application servers.
    * **Phase 2:** Evaluate migration of corresponding DEV/Test databases.

**Script (Approx. 70 seconds):**

"The real power comes when we scale this. Imagine these savings replicated across numerous DEV and Test application servers within Capital Markets. This POC demonstrates a clear path to significantly reduce our operational expenditure, while also increasing agility with faster environment provisioning.

Looking ahead, there's further potential to migrate other workloads and eventually even our on-premise databases for greater savings, although that’s a larger strategic discussion.

Our immediate recommendation is to proceed with a **phased rollout:**
First, expand the use of Google Cloud Preemptible VMs for all suitable DEV and Test application servers in Capital Markets.
Second, following that success, we should evaluate the migration of the corresponding non-production databases.

We believe this approach offers substantial financial benefits and modernizes our development practices."
