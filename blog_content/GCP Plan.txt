I'll help you create a detailed migration plan for moving your Spring Boot microservices to GCP while maintaining connectivity with on-premises systems. Let's break this down into phases:

Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
1. Architecture Analysis
   - Document current microservices architecture
   - Map dependencies between services
   - Identify integration points with on-premises systems:
     - Internal authorization services
     - Reference data services
     - On-premises database
   - Analyze network latency requirements between cloud and on-premises components
   - Document current resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage)

2. Network Planning
   - Design Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect setup between GCP and on-premises
   - Plan IP address ranges and subnetting
   - Define firewall rules and security policies
   - Evaluate database connection requirements and latency thresholds
   - Plan for monitoring and logging infrastructure

3. GCP Environment Setup
   - Choose target regions based on latency requirements
   - Design Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster architecture
   - Plan resource quotas and limitations
   - Design monitoring and logging strategy using Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging
   - Plan CI/CD pipeline modifications for GCP deployment

Phase 2: Foundation Setup
1. Network Implementation
   - Set up Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect
   - Configure routing between GCP and on-premises
   - Implement firewall rules
   - Test network connectivity and measure latencies
   - Set up Cloud DNS for service discovery

2. GCP Infrastructure
   - Create GCP project structure
   - Set up IAM roles and permissions
   - Create GKE clusters
   - Configure Cloud Storage buckets
   - Set up Cloud Build for CI/CD
   - Implement Secret Manager for sensitive data

3. Monitoring and Logging
   - Set up Cloud Monitoring
   - Configure log aggregation
   - Set up alerts and dashboards
   - Implement distributed tracing

Phase 3: Application Migration
1. Application Modifications
   - Update configuration management for GCP
   - Implement retry mechanisms for database connections
   - Update health check endpoints
   - Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
   - Update logging to work with Cloud Logging
   - Containerize applications if not already done

2. Database Connectivity
   - Set up secure database connectivity
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Configure failover handling
   - Set up monitoring for database connections
   - Test latency and throughput

3. Security Implementation
   - Set up service accounts
   - Implement Workload Identity
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates
   - Set up Cloud KMS for encryption
   - Implement IAM policies

Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Environment Testing
   - Perform load testing
   - Test network failover scenarios
   - Validate monitoring and alerting
   - Test security controls
   - Verify database connectivity under load

2. Application Testing
   - Unit testing in GCP environment
   - Integration testing with on-premises services
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing
   - Disaster recovery testing

Phase 5: Migration Execution
1. Pilot Migration
   - Select non-critical microservices for initial migration
   - Deploy to GCP environment
   - Validate functionality
   - Monitor performance
   - Gather learnings and adjust approach

2. Full Migration
   - Create detailed migration schedule
   - Plan for zero-downtime migration
   - Execute migration in phases
   - Implement traffic shifting gradually
   - Monitor system health during migration

Phase 6: Post-Migration
1. Optimization
   - Fine-tune resource allocation
   - Optimize costs
   - Improve performance
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Document lessons learned

2. Operations Setup
   - Update runbooks
   - Train support teams
   - Set up SLAs and SLOs
   - Implement automated scaling policies
   - Document troubleshooting procedures

Key Considerations:
1. Database Performance
   - Monitor latency between GCP and on-premises database
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Set up connection pooling properly
   - Plan for database failover scenarios

2. Security
   - Ensure all traffic between GCP and on-premises is encrypted
   - Implement proper authentication for all service-to-service communication
   - Regular security audits
   - Maintain compliance requirements

3. Cost Management
   - Set up budget alerts
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Implement auto-scaling policies
   - Regular cost optimization reviews

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific phase or aspect of this migration plan?
