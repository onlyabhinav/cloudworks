# Maximizing Code Reuse While Modernizing Legacy Applications

## The Challenge

When our business requested a new application with functionality nearly identical to an existing system, our initial instinct was to deploy the existing application as-is. However, we quickly discovered this wasn't feasible - the application was built on Java 8, Spring Boot 2.0, and Netflix Zuul, all of which were approaching end-of-life or had known vulnerabilities.

## Our Approach: Fork and Modernize

Instead of building from scratch, we adopted a hybrid approach:
1. Fork the existing application codebase
2. Modernize core components
3. Create shared libraries for common functionality

## Technical Upgrade Path

### Java 8 to Java 21 Migration
- Identified and resolved deprecated API usage
- Leveraged new features:
  - Records for data classes
  - Pattern matching for instanceof
  - Text blocks for SQL queries
  - Switch expressions
- Updated build configurations in Maven/Gradle
- Modified JVM parameters for optimal performance

### Spring Boot 2.0 to 2.7 Upgrade
- Updated dependency management
```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.0</version>
</parent>
```
- Migration challenges:
  - Actuator endpoint changes
  - Security autoconfiguration updates
  - Database connection pool modifications
  - Testing framework adaptations

### Netflix Zuul to Spring Cloud Gateway
- Replaced Zuul filters with Gateway predicates and filters
- Before:
```java
public class CustomZuulFilter extends ZuulFilter {
    @Override
    public String filterType() {
        return "pre";
    }
    // ...
}
```
- After:
```java
@Configuration
public class GatewayConfig {
    @Bean
    public RouteLocator customRouteLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
        return builder.routes()
            .route("path_route", r -> r.path("/api/**")
                .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader("Custom-Header", "Value"))
                .uri("lb://service-name"))
            .build();
    }
}
```

## Creating Reusable Components

### Common Repository Strategy
1. Identified shared functionality:
   - Authentication/Authorization modules
   - Utility classes
   - Common business logic
   - Shared DTOs and entities

2. Created a common library structure:
```
common-lib/
├── security/
├── utils/
├── dto/
└── config/
```

3. Implementation example:
```java
@Configuration
public class CommonSecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) {
        return http
            .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .jwt()
            .and()
            .build();
    }
}
```

### Version Management
- Used BOM (Bill of Materials) for dependency management
```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.company.common</groupId>
            <artifactId>common-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${common.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

## Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Dependency Conflicts
- Used Maven's dependency:tree to identify conflicts
- Created exclusion rules for transitive dependencies
- Implemented version management through parent POM

### Database Compatibility
- Updated connection pool configurations
- Modified query syntax for newer SQL features
- Implemented database versioning strategy

### API Compatibility
- Created API version mapping layer
- Implemented backward compatibility handlers
- Used interface-based design for flexibility

## Testing Strategy

1. Integration Testing:
```java
@SpringBootTest
class ServiceIntegrationTest {
    @Test
    void whenUsingNewFeatures_thenCompatibleWithOldSystem() {
        // Test both old and new functionality
    }
}
```

2. Compatibility Testing:
- Created test suites for both applications
- Implemented API contract testing
- Used shared test utilities

## Results and Benefits

1. Technical Achievements:
- Successful deployment of modernized application
- 80% code reuse between applications
- Improved performance metrics
- Reduced maintenance overhead

2. Business Benefits:
- Faster time-to-market (4 months)
- Cost savings through code reuse
- Reduced technical debt
- Improved scalability

## Lessons for Similar Projects

1. Planning Phase:
- Conduct thorough dependency analysis
- Create detailed upgrade roadmap
- Identify reusable components early

2. Implementation:
- Use feature toggles for gradual rollout
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Document all breaking changes

3. Deployment:
- Use blue-green deployment
- Monitor both applications
- Maintain rollback capability

## Future Considerations

- Regular dependency updates
- Continuous modernization strategy
- Automated upgrade testing
- Shared component versioning

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to successfully modernize legacy applications while maximizing code reuse. The key is balancing modernization with practical constraints while maintaining a clear focus on reusability and maintainability.

Our approach saved significant development time while delivering a modern, maintainable application. The shared components strategy ensures future updates benefit both applications, creating a sustainable path forward for our technology stack.
