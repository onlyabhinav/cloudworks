# Meta-Magic: Automating Postgres Deployments with psql Meta-Commands and DB_TOOL

Database deployments can be challenging, especially when managing multiple environments and ensuring consistency across releases. Recently, our team automated Postgres deployments using DB_TOOL, our in-house deployment tool, and I wanted to share our approach.

## The Challenge

Manual database deployments are error-prone and time-consuming. We needed a solution that would ensure consistency, support rollbacks, and provide clear verification of deployment success. The key was finding the right balance between automation and control.

## Our Solution: Structure and Simplicity

We built our automation around `psql` commands and meta-commands, leveraging Postgres's native capabilities rather than reinventing the wheel. The heart of our approach lies in a well-organized folder structure:

```
C:.
├── MAIN_APPLY.sql
├── MAIN_ROLLBACK.sql
├── README.md
├── 00_schema/
│   ├── create_schema.sql
│   └── drop_schema.sql
├── 01_tables/
│   ├── alter_tables.sql
│   ├── create_tables.sql
│   └── drop_tables.sql
├── 02_sequences/
│   ├── create_sequences.sql
│   └── drop_sequences.sql
├── 03_functions/
│   ├── create_functions.sql
│   └── drop_functions.sql
├── 04_data/
│   ├── delete_data.sql
│   └── insert_data.sql
├── 05_permissions/
│   ├── revoke_permissions.sql
│   └── set_permissions.sql
├── 06_views/
│   ├── create_views.sql
│   └── drop_views.sql
└── 99_verification/
    ├── apply_verification.sql
    ├── rollback_verification.sql
    └── verify.sql
```

## Why This Structure Works

### Numbered Folders

The prefix numbers (00-99) define the execution order, ensuring dependencies are handled correctly. Schemas are created first, then tables, sequences, and so on.

### Separation of Concerns

Each folder contains paired scripts for forward and backward operations (create/drop, insert/delete), making rollbacks straightforward and predictable.

### Verification Last

The `99_verification` folder runs after all other changes, confirming the deployment succeeded before marking it complete.

## Key Features

### Apply and Rollback Scripts

Our `MAIN_APPLY.sql` and `MAIN_ROLLBACK.sql` orchestrate the entire deployment using psql meta-commands like `\i` to include files in the correct sequence.

### Dynamic Schema Management with Variables

One of the most powerful features of our approach is using psql variables for schema names. Since we manage multiple schemas, we use the `\set` command to define variables dynamically:

```sql
\set schema_name 'my_application_schema'
```

Throughout our SQL scripts, we reference the schema using `:schema_name`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE :schema_name.users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE SEQUENCE :schema_name.order_seq;

GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA :schema_name TO readonly_user;
```

This approach provides several benefits:

- **Multi-schema Support**: Deploy the same scripts to different schemas by simply changing the variable value
- **Environment Flexibility**: Use different schema names for dev, staging, and production
- **Reduced Errors**: No manual find-and-replace operations that could miss instances
- **Cleaner Scripts**: Schema names are defined once at the top of the deployment

The DB_TOOL tool passes the appropriate schema name as a parameter, and our `MAIN_APPLY.sql` sets the variable before executing the numbered folders.

### Granular Control

Each database object type has its own folder with dedicated scripts, making it easy to locate and modify specific components.

### Built-in Verification

The verification scripts validate that changes were applied correctly, catching issues before they impact production.

## The Configuration Journey

While the structure itself is straightforward, setting up the automation required significant configuration. We had to define:

- Environment-specific variables
- Connection parameters
- Error handling strategies
- Transaction management within DB_TOOL

The upfront investment paid off with reliable, repeatable deployments.

## Results

Our automated approach has transformed how we deploy database changes:

- **Speed**: What once took hours of careful manual execution now runs in minutes
- **Confidence**: Automated verification ensures changes are applied correctly
- **Rollback Safety**: Rollbacks, which used to be nerve-wracking, are now simple and reliable
- **Better Reviews**: The structured approach improved our code review process—reviewers can quickly navigate to relevant sections and understand the scope of changes

## Looking Forward

This foundation positions us well for future enhancements:

- Automated testing of migration scripts
- Parallel execution where safe
- Integration with our CI/CD pipeline
- Deployment history and audit trails

## Conclusion

If you're managing Postgres deployments, consider adopting a similar structured approach. The initial setup effort will reward you with safer, faster, and more maintainable database operations.
