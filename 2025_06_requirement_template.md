Of course. Building on the need for a solid deployment process, having a clear and consistent requirements document is the crucial first step. This template is designed for a small, fast-moving team. It's comprehensive enough to prevent ambiguity but lightweight enough that it won't feel like a burden.

It captures all the items you mentioned and adds a few other best-practice sections like success metrics, out-of-scope definitions, and a stakeholder sign-off table.

Here is a template you can create in Confluence.

**How to Create the Template:**
1.  Navigate to your Confluence space.
2.  Click **Space settings** > **Look and feel** > **Templates**.
3.  Click **Create new template**.
4.  Copy and paste the content below into the template body.

### **Template: Requirement Specification**

**Title:** `[Feature/Requirement Name] - Specification`

**Labels:** `requirement`, `spec`, `[project-name]`

**(Pro-Tip: Use this template as the single source of truth for a new requirement. Link to it from your Jira Epic or Story.)**

| **Jira Epic/Story:** | `/jira` *Link the primary Jira ticket here* |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Status:** | `/status` *e.g., Inception, Design, In Progress, Ready for UAT* |
| **Product Owner:** | `@mention` *Who has the final say on the requirements?* |
| **Tech Lead:** | `@mention` *Who is responsible for the technical design?* |
| **Target Release Date:** | `/date` |

### 1. Overview & Business Value

#### 1.1. Problem Statement
`/placeholder` *Describe the problem this requirement solves from the user's perspective. What pain point are we addressing? Why is this important to do now?*

#### 1.2. Goals & Success Metrics
`/placeholder` *How will we know we have succeeded? Define 1-3 specific, measurable outcomes.*
* **Goal 1:** `/placeholder` *e.g., Allow users to reset their own passwords.*
* **Metric 1:** `/placeholder` *e.g., Reduce password-reset support tickets by 90%.*
* **Goal 2:** `/placeholder` *e.g., Improve the login page user experience.*
* **Metric 2:** `/placeholder` *e.g., Decrease the time spent on the login page by 15%.*

### 2. Scope & Functional Requirements

#### 2.1. In-Scope Requirements
`/placeholder` *Use a checklist for a clear, itemized list of what will be delivered. Be specific.*
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to click a "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
- [ ] The system must send a time-sensitive password reset link to the user's registered email.
- [ ] The user must be able to set a new password that meets our security complexity rules.

#### 2.2. Out-of-Scope
`/placeholder` *This is as important as what's in-scope. Clearly state what we are NOT doing to prevent scope creep.*
-   This project will not include changing the login page's UI design.
-   This does not include a "remember me" functionality.
-   Password reset via SMS is not part of this work.

### 3. Technical Design & Action Taken

`/placeholder` *Describe the technical approach for implementation. This section can be updated as work progresses.*
* **Frontend:** `/placeholder` *e.g., Create a new React component for the password reset form.*
* **Backend:** `/placeholder` *e.g., Develop a new REST API endpoint `/api/v1/auth/reset-password`.*
* **Database:** `/placeholder` *e.g., No schema changes required. A temporary token will be stored in Redis.*
* **Key Decisions:** `/placeholder` *Log important technical decisions made, e.g., "Decided to use SendGrid for email delivery due to existing integration."*

### 4. Impact Analysis

`/placeholder` *What existing parts of the system will this change affect?*
* **Impacted Functionality:** `/placeholder` *e.g., The main login form, user profile page.*
* **Upstream/Downstream Services:** `/placeholder` *e.g., The mobile app's login flow will need to be updated in a separate ticket.*
* **User Documentation:** `/placeholder` *The public-facing help documentation will need to be updated to include the new workflow.*

### 5. Testing Strategy

#### 5.1. QA & Automated Testing
`/placeholder` *Outline the plan for ensuring quality.*
* **Unit Tests:** `/placeholder` *e.g., New tests will be written for the `AuthService` in the backend.*
* **Integration Tests:** `/placeholder` *e.g., An end-to-end test will be created to simulate the full password reset flow.*
* **Manual QA:** `/placeholder` *Link to the QA test plan or list key scenarios to test manually.*

#### 5.2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan
`/placeholder` *How will business users or product owners validate this?*
* **Testers:** `@mention Product Owner` `@mention Stakeholder`
* **Test Scenarios:**
    1.  Verify a user can successfully reset their password.
    2.  Verify the reset link expires after the configured time (e.g., 1 hour).
    3.  Verify an invalid email address shows a user-friendly error.

### 6. Release Plan

#### 6.1. Deployment Dependencies
- [ ] **Code Merge:** `[Link to GitHub Pull Request]`
- [ ] **Infrastructure:** `/placeholder` *e.g., Redis cache needs to be available in the PROD environment.*
- [ ] **Configuration:** `/placeholder` *e.g., New environment variables for SendGrid API key must be set.*

#### 6.2. Runbook Summary
`/placeholder` *Provide a high-level summary of the deployment steps. Link to the detailed runbook page created from your other template.*

ðŸ”— **Link to full Deployment Runbook:** `[Create and link the runbook page here]`

### 7. Open Questions & Assumptions

`/placeholder` *Use this section to track unresolved questions and assumptions made during planning.*
* **Question:** What is the exact copy for the password reset email? (Assigned to `@mention Product Owner`)
* **Assumption:** We assume that all users have valid email addresses in the system.

### 8. Stakeholder Sign-off

`/placeholder` *Use this table to confirm that key stakeholders have reviewed and approved the plan.*

| **Role** | **Name** | **Status** | **Date** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Product Owner | `@mention` | `/status` *Approved* | `/date` |
| Tech Lead | `@mention` | `/status` *Approved* | `/date` |
| QA Lead | `@mention` | `/status` *Not Started* | |

**How to Use This Template:**
* **Fill it out early:** Create this page as soon as a new requirement is being seriously considered.
* **It's a living document:** Update the status, technical design, and open questions as you progress.
* **Remove what you don't need:** For very small, simple changes, feel free to remove non-applicable sections like "Success Metrics" or "Sign-off." The goal is clarity, not bureaucracy.
